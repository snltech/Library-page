The project consists of creating a library of books.

The library can be in 2 shapes/forms:
1) Table
2) Grid with info of each book inside the Grid

The library will contain the following info:
1) Title
2) Author
3) Number of pages in the book
4) Status of the book, meaning: Read / Not Read

Challenges:
1) Making the button that takes new books trigger a pop-up, requires further learning of:
    -   Positioning
    -   Transform properties
    -   Overlay properties
    -   Global box sizing setting
2) A good revision of JS selectors and forms
3) Adding elements to the table with a remove button in the table that can trigger the deletion of parent row
4) Checking for duplicates in the table so that the same book does not get added twice
